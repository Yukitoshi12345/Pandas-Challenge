<h1 align = "center"> Pandas Challenge </h1>

In this Pandas Challenge project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a district's educational performance using the Pandas library. The primary objective was to gain insights into various key metrics at both the district and school levels. I began with a high-level district summary that included the total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects. This initial overview set the stage for a more granular examination of individual schools. For each school, I summarised critical metrics such as school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and the passing percentages for math, reading, and both subjects.

Further analysis involved identifying the highest and lowest performing schools based on the overall passing percentage. Additionally, I explored average scores by grade level, providing insights into performance trends across 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. I also analysed school performance based on spending per student, categorising schools into spending ranges and examining the relationship between spending and performance. Moreover, I investigated how school size impacted performance by categorising schools into small, medium, and large sizes. Lastly, I explored performance differences based on school types (e.g., charter vs. district). Through this multifaceted analysis, I uncovered valuable insights and trends that could inform decision-making and policy development within the educational district.

## Criteria

```
District Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary

- Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
- Include the following:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

- Sort the schools by `% Overall Passing` in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
- Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

- Sort the schools by `% Overall Passing` in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
- Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

Math Scores by Grade

- Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade

- Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending

- Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student)
- Use `pd.cut` to categorize spending based on the bins.

Use the scores above to create a DataFrame called
Include the following metrics in the table:
- Average math score
- Average reading score spending_summary.
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Scores by School Size

- Use the following code to bin the per_school_summary.
- Use `pd.cut` on the "Total Students" column of the `per_school_summary` DataFrame.
- Create a DataFrame called `size_summary` that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

Scores by School Type

- Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called `type_summary`.
- This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".
